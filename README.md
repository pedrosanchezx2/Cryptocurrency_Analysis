Challenge 19




Unsupervised machine learning is a powerful technique used to uncover patterns and clusters within data when the output is unknown. Its primary purpose is to explore data and extract information without having a specific question in mind. There are two main applications of unsupervised learning: data transformation and clustering or pattern recognition. In data transformation, data is simplified for further analysis or use in another machine learning model. Clustering involves grouping data points into clusters or detecting patterns without the goal of classification.

To prepare data for analysis, it is essential to follow three key steps: data selection, data processing, and data transformation. Data selection involves choosing appropriate data for analysis, while data processing entails formatting, cleaning, and sampling the data. Data transformation converts data into a simpler format for future use.

This project aims to use a cryptocurrencies dataset to persuade Accountability Accounting, a leading investment bank, to invest in the cryptocurrency market and offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients. Clustering algorithms such as the K-means algorithm and hierarchical clustering have been chosen to analyze the data and aid in decision-making. The K-means algorithm divides the data into K clusters based on their similarity or distance to a centroid. Hierarchical clustering, on the other hand, groups data points into clusters by merging the most similar clusters until a stopping point is reached.

In conclusion, unsupervised machine learning is a vital tool for data analysis when the output is unknown. Data transformation and clustering are two key applications of unsupervised learning. Data selection, data processing, and data transformation are important steps in preparing data for analysis. The use of clustering algorithms, such as the K-means algorithm and hierarchical clustering, can help in analyzing data and making informed decisions.
